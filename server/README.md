# Insecure Web Server

This is a web server written in Python, heavily inspired from basic things I've learned over the years about SQL injection, CS 341, and [an example I found online](https://github.com/BrenesRM/insecure-web) but without the disgusting AI generated image in the background.

You are free to reuse this and mess with the code for educational purposes. This should go without saying, but PLEASE do not use this to actually host anything. :)
