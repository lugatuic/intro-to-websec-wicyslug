# LUG X WiCyS - Intro to Web Security

For our first Cybersecurity themed workshop for the WiCyS X LUG Cybersecurity collab weeks!

This workshop was designed to provide a very surface level introduction to fuzzing both conceptually and practically.

This workshop was developed with Open Source security tools in mind. It will thusly use them. You are free to use alternatives.

The `slides` directory contains the source files for the slide deck presented at the meeting. The `server` directory corresponds with the files for the web server being fuzzed, written in Python for simplicity.

Yes, it could have been written in Rust, but the focus is on fuzzing the server, not making it efficient, nor is it expected to be used outside of this workshop! :)
